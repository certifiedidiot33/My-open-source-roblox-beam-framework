My open source roblox beam framework
----------------------------------------
Thanks for choosing this framework!
please remember to credit me!
-----------------------------------------
To use the framework ungroup the models where they say.
for instance serverscriptservice would mean you ungroup it there.
-----------------------------------------
as far as this goes for power do remember this is in early alpha so things are subject to change
# NOTE: THIS IS ONLY MEANT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCRIPTING
-----------------------------------------
some usefull things are stated below:

for i,v in pairs(game.Workspace.BEAMSYSTEMFOLDERHERE:GetChildren())do
--//This allows you to duplicate the model and it still work, an example is stated below:

--//v.Motors.Pan.DesiredAngle = 1

end


--//For things like parts and lights, transparency is called by doing | part.Transparency = value 

--//However, A Beam has to be changed by doing | beam.Transparency = NumberSequence.New(value)
